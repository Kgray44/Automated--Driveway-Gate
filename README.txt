Sighthound Cloud Vehicle License Plate Recognition API Example - Python 2.7.11+

Verify python on your computer

    Open a command line

    Check you python version with the following command:
        python --version

    If you get an error like "python: command not found" then you will need to install python.
        Find it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

    If your python version is less than 2.7.11, then you will need to upgrade it.

Install the Pillow package

    Under OS-X and Windows, from the command line:
        pip install Pillow
    
    Under linux, install the 'python-imaging' package.

Set your Sighthound Cloud Token

    In your browser, go to: https://www.sighthound.com/support/creating-api-token
    You might need to create an account, if you don't already have one.
    Or, press the "Sighthound Cloud section" if you do have an account.
    If you have a token under "Your API Tokens" then use that token.
    Or, press the "New Token" button to generate your token and use that one.
    Your token is identified by a string of random looking letters and numbers.
    
    Make sure you are in "sighthound-lpr-cloud-examples/code-samples-python" for the following:
    
    Edit the file "lpr-recognition.py" and find this line:
        "_cloud_token = "YourSighthoundCloudToken"
    Replace "YourSighthoundCloudToken" with your token string.
    Save the file and return to the command line.
    
    From the command line, in the python directory, perform the following command:
    
        python lpr-recognition.py
    
    when it completed, there will be a new directory in the python directory, called "out".
    This is where the test images are rewritten with annotations for cars and license plates.
